In this study, we’re interested in learning how people across different occupations want  agents to assist in their work. This survey targets people who work as Payroll and Timekeeping Clerks or had experience in this area before. Please ensure you satisfy this requirement before you participate in this study.

What are  agents?

An  agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about  agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop  agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

3. Answer brief demographic questions

The survey will take approximately 10–15 minutes.",Artificial Intelligence,,,,,Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,,,

Create Automated LinkedIn Content Generator Automation,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-Automated-LinkedIn-Content-Generator-Automation_~021914489807770310889/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,AI,Fixed,,,,,150.0,150.0,"📌 Overview (Revised for Clarity)
I’m building a system that automatically generates LinkedIn posts using GPT-4, based on my brand voice and content strategy.

I want it to run on autopilot—generating one post per weekday—without me needing to manually feed it ideas every time. That said, I do want the flexibility to add my own ideas when I choose.

The system should:

Pull ideas from a Notion database (which may include manually entered ideas or content pulled from meetings/notes)

Send them to GPT-4 using a custom LinkedIn prompt I provide

Save the draft in a second Notion database for me to review, edit, and post

I'm looking for someone who can build this using Zapier, Notion, and Open—and deliver a clean, reliable system I can use and later offer to clients.

🛠️ What I Need You to Build:
1. Automation Flow (Zapier)

Scheduled trigger: once per weekday

Pull the next available idea from a Notion Content Seeds database

If nothing is available, system can either pause or use a backup/default theme bank

Send idea + metadata (Post Type, Tone) to Open using a custom LinkedIn prompt I’ll provide (includes voice, structure, CTA logic, etc.)

Output: Create or update a Notion record in the LinkedIn Drafts database

Fields include: Content Idea,  Draft, Tone, Post Type, Status

Mark the seed as “Used” with timestamp

2. Two Notion Databases

Content Seeds

Stores raw snippets, notes, voice memos (manually or automatically sourced)

Fields: Idea Snippet, Post Type Tag, Tone Hint, Source, Status, Date Added

LinkedIn Draft Generator

Receives the -generated drafts

Fields: Content Idea,  Draft, Final Copy, Post Type, Tone, Status, Date Used

3. Integration of My GPT Prompt

I’ll provide a structured prompt that includes:

My LinkedIn content strategy (based on the 4-1-1 rule)

Hook/re-hook formatting

Tone guidance and audience context

You’ll set up the Zap to send dynamic fields into this prompt

🔁 Bonus Features (Ideal but not required):
Option to pull ideas from my meeting notes (Fathom or Google Doc) via Zapier

A fallback system if the Content Seeds database is empty (e.g. random ideas or templates)

✅ Deliverables
Fully functioning Zapier flow (daily post draft automation)

Notion databases set up and connected

Open integration with custom prompt

Simple guide (Notion doc or Loom) to explain how I can edit, review, and reuse the system

🧠 Ideal Background
This project is perfect for someone who has:

The app should assign realistic  voices to characters, integrate background sounds, and provide users with customization options for both voices and sounds.

Key Features:

1. Immersive Script-to-Audio Conversion
Story Magic allows users to upload their screenplay and instantly convert it into a fully produced audio experience. Unlike basic text-to-speech tools, the platform uses intelligent scene parsing to match the emotional tone, pacing, and structure of the script — giving writers and filmmakers the ability to hear their story in a compelling, cinematic format.

2. Smart Voice Assignment with Customization
Story Magic uses -powered script analysis to automatically scan uploaded screenplays and intelligently assign voice profiles to each character. The system reads character cues, scene descriptions, and dialogue patterns to match each role with a realistic  voice that reflects the character’s tone, personality, and emotional weight — ensuring a compelling and authentic listening experience right out of the box.

Users can instantly preview and swap voices for any character or narrator through an intuitive menu, customizing pitch, energy level, and speaking style to better align with their vision. Whether testing different vocal dynamics, simulating alternate casting options, or adjusting for tone, this feature allows for creative flexibility without technical complexity.

It’s like holding a live casting session — only faster, frictionless, and mobile.

3. Realistic  Voice Cloning
The app uses advanced  voice cloning to generate lifelike character performances with natural cadence, tone, and emotional nuance. Voices are customized to match character descriptions, allowing for more authentic scene dynamics. This gives users a strong sense of casting fit and character presence — far beyond robotic or monotone alternatives.

4. Professional Narration Engine
Every script is guided by a high-quality, story-driven narrator who provides continuity, transitions, and exposition where needed. The narration adds clarity to the audio experience, especially in early-stage drafts where scenes may shift rapidly or include visual cues.

5. Dynamic Ambient Soundscapes
Story Magic automatically layers ambient background sound — such as bustling cities, quiet forests, echoing halls, or military tents — based on scene descriptions and context cues in the script. This adds spatial depth and mood, helping users visualize the world of the story through audio.

6. Mobile-First Script Upload and Editing
Optimized for iOS and Android, Story Magic offers seamless script import options from cloud services, email, or integrated writing tools. A clean, intuitive interface allows users to quickly upload, preview, and revise scripts without switching platforms or desktop software.

7. Scene-by-Scene Playback Control
Users can listen to individual scenes, replay specific dialogue, or jump between acts with ease. This segmented playback system helps users focus on pacing, fine-tune edits, or rehearse specific moments in isolation.

8. Shareable Audio Links
Completed audio drafts can be shared via private streaming links with collaborators, agents, producers, or mentors. This feature is especially useful for pitching, note sessions, and early-stage development, making it easier to generate feedback without requiring full table reads or live sessions.

9. SAG-Compliant Voice Licensing System (In Development)
In alignment with the Screen Actors Guild, Story Magic is developing a voice licensing system that allows professional actors to license their voices for use within the platform. This ensures ethical voice usage, generates new revenue for industry professionals, and positions Story Magic as an industry-approved solution in the era of  performance.

10. Revenue Sharing for Film Industry Support
A percentage of Story Magic’s revenue will go toward funding the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, serving as a supplemental safety net for artists and creators facing unemployment or industry disruptions. This built-in support mechanism reinforces the company’s commitment to elevating and protecting the creative workforce.

11. Education-Friendly Access for Film Schools
Story Magic offers tailored access and licensing options for film schools, writing programs, and academic institutions. Students can use the platform to hear their scripts in action, gaining practical insight into performance, tone, and scene structure in a way no textbook or static script can provide.

Entrepreneurial.  This is because we are planning on doing product development for a content management platform in the Christian space.

Humble. We serve customers with custom software development, and this person must be able to easily communicate with customers without being arrogant about their own amazing skills.

Highly Skilled.  This project is not for your average developer.  This will require senior-level dev skills that have been honed over time with experience.  Thinking out of the box to get things done is important.  A willingness to use tools and not code everything by hand is great, but this is a challenging project.  You have to know your speed and estimate projects well so the customer expectations can be correctly set.  You MUST have solid experience using  for app development.

Customer Friendly.  This means you are not your ordinary developer but can have an intelligent conversation with a customer, able to have business level conversations respectfully.

Responsible. Freelancers are able to pick up work and drop work as they please.  Its part of the allure of being a freelancer.  But we need someone who communicates well and will stay committed to a project. Dropping a project in the middle simply because it is hard, or you have more interesting things to do is not responsible.  We love working with great people who are committed to working hard, even when it is challenging.

Bleeding Edge Practical. We love pushing the envelope with our work, but we have to do it in ways that are sustainable, don't waste money, and can be supported long term.

Customer Passionate. You love what you do, and you love serving customers with your skills. We take customer success very seriously.

Capable of Leading.  We have a team of coders you may be overseeing on projects for other tasks.  Being able to be a respected leader is important.

We are developing new apps from the ground up for ourselves and our customers.  We are a marketing agency, but migrating more and more into mobile app and web app development.

Please please please, do not respond to this if you are a company (unless you are a company of 1).  Also, do not fake it on the above requirements.  If you don't match, it will be obvious really quick and it will be wasted time for all of us.  Please do not respond to this using an -generated response (we see it a lot and can usually spot them ... so far anyway).  Please do not respond if you are just going to sub out the work to someone else (we immediately fire and report them here when it happens).
